my understanding and application of Python programming in real-world scenarios. Each task focused on a specific domain such as API integration, report automation, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML). Below is a brief overview of the tasks, along with the tools and technologies used and the editor I preferred throughout the internship

Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization
The first task involved creating a Python script that fetches data from a public API—OpenWeatherMap in my case—and visualizes the information using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
API integration and data visualization is a crucial task that involves fetching real-time data from an external source and presenting it in an understandable format. This process is widely used in industries such as finance, healthcare, and weather forecasting, where dynamic data plays a vital role in decision-making
Objective:
The goal of this task is to use Python to connect to a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), extract relevant data, process it, and visualize it using graphs or charts. This helps in understanding data patterns and trends efficiently
